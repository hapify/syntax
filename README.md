# Hapify Syntax

## Description

This repository parses templates written with the Hapify Syntax.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hapify/syntax.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hapify/syntax) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/hapify/syntax/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/hapify/syntax)

## Pre-requisites

Before reading this article, we recommend that you read the documentation about [models and fields structure](https://www.hapify.io/documentation/templating).

## Wrappers

Opening tag: `<<`.

Closing tag: `>>`.

Usually used for binary operations. Should be escapable:
Escaped tags `\<\<` (and `\>\>`) are replaced by `<<` (and `>>`) in the generated content.

## Syntax

```
<<@ F se*so/lb f>>
<<@>>
```

Explanations:

-   `@` is the operation
-   `F` is the variable
-   `se*so/lb` is the condition (optional)
-   `f` is the assignment variable

### Variable naming

Lower case is for a dynamically defined variable.
Upper case is for a pre-defined variable.

To refer to the root variable, we use `M` (model or models).
It refers to the model in a single model template and to the models list in a multiple model template.

In the template's scope, this root variable is named `root`.
Therefore, `M` is just a shortcut to `root`.

By default, in a case of a single model template:

-   `F` refers to the fields list: `root.fields.list`
-   `D` refers to the models list: `root.dependencies`
-   `R` refers to the models list: `root.referencedIn`
-   `P` refers to the models primary field: `root.fileds.primary`
-   `A` refers to the action's accesses list: `root.accesses.list`
-   `Ac` refers to the create action's access: `root.accesses.create`
-   `Ar` refers to the read action's access: `root.accesses.read`
-   `Au` refers to the update action's access: `root.accesses.update`
-   `Ad` refers to the delete (remove) action's access: `root.accesses.remove`
-   `As` refers to the search action's access: `root.accesses.search`
-   `An` refers to the count action's access: `root.accesses.count`

## Conditional operator

This operator can be used over an object or an array of objects.
If used over an array, it will test the length of the array filtered by the condition.

As an array, it can be used over any object containing a method `filter` that receives a callback returning a boolean.
In the model structure, `root.dependencies` is an object that contains a `filter` method.
Then, this operator can test if a model has dependencies that has fields with a specific condition.

### Syntax

```
<<? F tE*ml>>
<<?>>
```

Tests if the model has at least one multiple entity.

### Operators

We use algebra operands to represent logical operations.

-   `*` is an intersection: `se ∩ lb` => `se * lb` => `se && lb`.
-   `+` is an union: `se ∪ lb` => `se + lb` => `se || se`.
-   `/` is an intersection with the complementary: `se ∩ !lb` => `se * !lb` => `se / lb` => `se && !lb`.
-   `-` is an union with the complementary: `se ∪ !lb` => `se + !lb` => `se - lb` => `se || !lb`.

If the condition starts with `-` or `/` it will be assimilated to `!`.
Therefore, `-se*so` and `/se*so` are equivalent to `!se*so`.

### Properties short-codes

To filter an array or to test a field by its properties, we use short-codes.

Short-codes available for a field:

-   `pr` for the boolean property `primary`
-   `un` for the boolean property `unique`
-   `lb` for the boolean property `label`
-   `nu` for the boolean property `nullable`
-   `ml` for the boolean property `multiple`
-   `em` for the boolean property `embedded`
-   `se` for the boolean property `searchable`
-   `so` for the boolean property `sortable`
-   `hd` for the boolean property `hidden`
-   `in` for the boolean property `internal`
-   `rs` for the boolean property `restricted`
-   `os` for the boolean property `ownership`
-   `tS` to test if property `type` is `string`
    -   `tSe` to test if properties `type` is `string` and `subtype` is `email`

    -   `tNi` to test if properties `type` is `number` and `subtype` is `integer`
    -   `tNf` to test if properties `type` is `number` and `subtype` is `float`

    - `tFa` to test if properties `type` is `file` and `subtype` is `audio`
    - `tFd` to test if properties `type` is `file` and `subtype` is `document`

Short-codes available for the properties of a model:

-   `pMHd` for the boolean property `mainlyHidden`
-   `pMIn` for the boolean property `mainlyInternal`
-   `pGeo` for the boolean property `isGeolocated`
-   `pGSe` for the boolean property `isGeoSearchable`

#### Access controls

To filter an array or to test an action by its properties, use those short-codes:

-   `ad` for the boolean property `admin`
-   `ow` for the boolean property `owner`
-   `au` for the boolean property `auth`
-   `gs` for the boolean property `guest`
-   `[ad` for the boolean property `gteAdmin`
-   `[ow` for the boolean property `gteOwner`
-   `[au` for the boolean property `gteAuth`
-   `[gs` for the boolean property `gteGuest`
-   `ad]` for the boolean property `lteAdmin`
-   `ow]` for the boolean property `lteOwner`
-   `au]` for the boolean property `lteAuth`
-   `gs]` for the boolean property `lteGuest`

Short-codes available for the access' properties of a model:

-   `pOAd` for the boolean property `onlyAdmin`
-   `pOOw` for the boolean property `onlyOwner`
-   `pOAu` for the boolean property `onlyAuth`
-   `pOGs` for the boolean property `onlyGuest`

-   `pNOw` for the boolean property `noOwner`
-   `pNAu` for the boolean property `noAuth`
-   `pNGs` for the boolean property `noGuest`

### Structure

A complete conditional writing will look like this:

```
<<?4 F hd>>
    This model has at least 4 hidden fields
<<??2 F lb+tB>>
    This model has at least 2 label or boolean fields
<<?? P tS>>
    The primary key of the model is a string
<<??>>
    Something else
<<?>>
```

Is equivalent to:

```javascript
if (root.fields.list.filter(f => f.hidden).length >= 4) {
	out += '    This model has at least 4 hidden fields';
} else if (
	root.fields.list.filter(f => f.label || f.type === 'boolean').length >= 2
) {
	out += '    This model has at least 2 label or boolean fields';
} else if (root.fields.primary.type === 'string') {
	out += '    The primary key of the model is a string';
} else {
	out += '    Something else';
}
```

### Statements Analysis

#### if

`<<?4 F hd>>` is equivalent to: `if (condition) {`.

-   `<<?` is the opener.
-   `4` is the minimum length of the filtered array. This value is optional and only usable if the variable is an array. If omitted, we assume the required length is 1.
-   `F` is the variable to test. It can be and array or an object.
-   `hd` is the condition to test the object or the items of an array.
-   `>>` closes the tag

#### else if

`<<??2 F lb+tB>>` Js equivalent would be: `} else if (condition) {`.
It follows the same rules as an **if** statement, unless its opener is `<<??`.

#### else 

`<<??>>` is equivalent to: `} else {`.

#### closer 

`<<?>>` is equivalent to: `}`.


### Examples

#### Example with conditions:

This tests if the model has some searchable and sortable but not hidden fields

```
<<? F se*so/hd>>
    ...
<<?>>
```

Is equivalent to:

```javascript
if (
	root.fields.list.filter(f => f.searchable && f.sortable && !f.hidden)
		.length > 0
) {
	out += '...';
}
```

#### Example without condition:

```
<<? F>>
    .....
<<?>>
```

Is equivalent to:

```javascript
if (root.fields.list.length > 0) {
	out += '.....';
}
```

#### Example with more than 2 elements

Example to test if the model has at least two label fields

```
<<?2 F lb>>
    ...
<<?>>
```

Is equivalent to:

```javascript
if (root.fields.list.filter(f => f.label).length >= 2) {
	out += '.....';
}
```

#### Example for a specific action's access

Example to test if the update action is restricted to admin or owner

```
<<? Au ad+ow>>
    .....
<<?>>
```

Is equivalent to:

```javascript
if (root.accesses.update.admin || root.accesses.update.owner) {
	out += '.....';
}
```

#### Example for many action's accesses

Example to test if at least one action is restricted to authenticated user or less

```
<<? A au]>>
    .....
<<?>>
```

Is equivalent to:

```javascript
if (root.accesses.filter(a => a.lteAuth).length > 0) {
	out += '.....';
}
```

## Iteration operator

The loop operation (foreach) is `@`.

It applies only to an array.
It uses the same conditions syntax as the conditional operator.

Actually, it inherits from the conditional operator.

### Syntax

```
<<@ F tE*ml f>>
<<@>>
```

The operators and the properties used in the condition are the same as for the conditional operator.
This will loop over all fields of type entity and multiple and assign the current field to the variable `f`.

### Structure

A complete iteration will look like this:

```
<<@4 F hd f>>
    Do something
<<@>>
```

Is equivalent to:

```javascript
for (let f of root.fields.list.filter(f => f.hidden).slice(0, 4)) {
	out += '    Do something';
}
```

### Analysis

#### loop

`<<@4 F hd>>` is equivalent to: `for (assigment + condition) {`.

-   `<<@` is the opener.
-   `4` is the maximum length of the filtered array. This value is optional. If omitted, we do not slice the filtered array.
-   `F` is the variable to filter and to loop on. It must be iterable.
-   `hd` is the condition to test the items of the array.
-   `f` is the assignment variable. This variable will be available inside the loop's scope.
-   `>>` closes the tag.

#### closer 

`<<@>>` is equivalent to: `}`.


### Examples

#### Example with conditions over fields:

To loop over model's searchable entity fields

```
<<@ F se*tE f>>
    ...
<<@>>
```

Is equivalent to

```javascript
for (let f of root.fields.list.filter(f => f.searchable && f.type === 'entity')) {
	out += '...';
}
```

#### Example with conditions over models:

In the context of a multiple models template, this loops over all models that are geo-located.

```
<<@ M pGeo m>>
    .....
<<@>>
```

Is equivalent to:

```javascript
for (let m of root.filter(i => i.properties.isGeolocated)) {
	out += '.....';
}
```

#### Example with 2 elements

This example will loop over the two first dependency models that have sortable fields.

```
<<@2 D so d>>
    ...
<<@>>
```

Is equivalent to:

```javascript
for (let d of root.dependencies.filter(f => f.sortable).slice(0, 2)) {
	out += '...';
}
```

#### Example without conditions

This will loop over all fields.

```
<<@ F f>>
    .....
<<@>>
```

Is equivalent to:

```javascript
for (let f of root.fields.list) {
	out += '.....';
}
```

#### Example with accesses

This will loop over all actions restricted to admin or owner.

```
<<@ A ad+ow>>
    .....
<<@>>
```

Is equivalent to:

```javascript
for (let f of root.accesses.list.filter(a => a.admin || a.owner)) {
	out += '...';
}
```

## Name interpolation

Name interpolation is the default operation.
To print the name of a variable (model or field), we omit the operation.

Example for the root model's name as upper camel:

```
<<M AA>>
```

Example for field's name as kebab:

```
<<f a-a>>
```

The values for the name are:

-   `aA` for `names.camel`
-   `AA` for `names.pascal`
-   `a` for `names.lower`
-   `A` for `names.capital`
-   `a-a` for `names.kebab`
-   `A-A` for `names.header`
-   `a_a` for `names.snake`
-   `A_A` for `names.constant`
-   `aa` for `names.compact`
-   `R` for `names.raw`

## Raw inputs

This operator allows you to write pure Javascript.

### Syntax

-   Opener: `<<<`
-   Closer: `>>>`

Those tags are also escapable.

Between those tags you can write pure Javascript code to inject new variables and new functions into the template scope.

### Output

The output variable is named `out`.
Therefore to concatenate a string to the template output, you have to write: `<<< out += 'more content here'; >>>`.

### Examples

Insert a custom variable:

```
<<< const l = model.fields.length; >>>
```

Declare a processing function:

```
<<<
function fieldName(f) {
    return f.names.snake.toUpperCase();
}
>>>
```

## Interpolation

This operator prints the content of a variable.
It is useful to print the result of a custom function or the value of a custom variable.

### Syntax

`<<= myFunction() >>` or `<<=customVariable>>`

This is equivalent to `<<< out += myFunction(); >>>`.

### Error

Do not write this: `<<= JSON.stringify(root) >>`.
The `root` object has recursive properties. Therefore this command will enter an infinite loop.

## Comments

This operator writes a comment in the template without any output to the generated file.

```
<<# This is just a comment>>
```
